### Progress Log

- added default date to date fields on the modal
- centered the dash between the date fields on the modal
- changed all datetime pickers to use tempus dominus
- linked all paired datetime pickers except for add-entry-modal pickers
- added 7 days to default end date for recurring shift

### Issues

- We're running into an issue with the date time pickers not being able to be disabled while using tempus dominus
- We have a dilemma with the filtering (nullable fields vs check boxes)
