### Progress Log
- Added time pickers to the records of the table on the timesheets page.
- Linked the time pickers on the entry modal on the timesheets page.
- Linked the time pickers on the search area on the timesheets page.
- Moved some datetimepicker.js code to the timesheets page. (change later)
- Changing css and styling for the webapp.
    - Button groups and colours.

### Issues
- Changes made to site.css are breaking the tempus dominus calendars.
- Time pickers values are currently being deleted on their button clicks (value is still assigned)

### Other
- Reclone the github files -> missing content from the lastest push
- Stuck on timepickers not working for a while.
    - Clear cache, check id names, check class names and make sure the js files are         linked.
