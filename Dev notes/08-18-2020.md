### Progress Log
- Added validation for all datetime and time pickers.
- Updated Jquery.
- Updated scripts and got rid of irrelavent ones.

### Issues

- searching by position doesnt work volunteer list

- when searching on volunteer page, then navigating to a detail page, then pressing the back button, a form resubmission error occurs. this is because the Main search handler doesnt redirect to its get handler

- trying to delete a recurring set with excluded shifts causes a foreign key constraint error (due to a db corruption, was resolved when db was reset)

- datetimepickers need to be set to readonly on schedule

- volunteer active nav links arent highlighting

- volunteer logout can be reversed with back button

- timepicker validation is causing errors on recurringshift modal
