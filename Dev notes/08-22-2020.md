### Progress Log

- Fixed FirstAidCprLevel validation issue on registration form
- Fixed FirstAidCprLevel mapping issue issue. All occurences are now strings, not ints
- Fixed position search on admin's Main page
- Fixed issue where certificate expiry dates and first aid's level weren't displaying on VolunteerDetails
- Added validation summary to VolunteerDetails to improve UX

### Issues  

- searching by position doesnt work volunteer list

- when searching on volunteer page, then navigating to a detail page, then pressing the back button, a form resubmission error occurs. this is because the Main search handler doesnt redirect to its get handler

- trying to delete a recurring set with excluded shifts causes a foreign key constraint error (due to a db corruption, was resolved when db was reset)

- datetimepickers need to be set to readonly on schedule

- volunteer active nav links arent highlighting

- volunteer logout can be reversed with back button

- timepicker validation is causing errors on recurringshift modal

### Other 

### Whats up next 

- Smooth over the app to make sure there are no bugs for tomorrow.
- Add readonly to dtp on clockout modal. 
- Add readonly to timepickers everywhere
