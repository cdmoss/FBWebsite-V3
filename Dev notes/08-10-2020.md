### Progress Log

- edit button for each time entry now causes:
    - delete and edit buttons on all other entries to disappear 
    - cancel button and save chnages to appear
        - cancel button restores all entry's buttons to normal and all fields to readonly
    - all fields for that entry to editable

- Save Changes button now works (it uses Request.Form)
- searching timesheet entries now works for any type of filter

### Issues

- time selector on tempus widget should be extended across the entire bottom
- tempus datetime widget does not disappear when unfocused

- investigate GetSearchedPosition in searcher, doesn't seem like a good way to do it
