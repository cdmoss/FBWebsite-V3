### Progress Log

- Added validation to all time pickers and date time pickers in the application 
- Fixed a lot of js code to allow for more optimized code in use of all tempus dominus time and date pickers. 
- Fixed searching to allow for capital and lower case searching. 
- Fixed searching on timesheets to allow for using both search bars. (Current and completed search bars are working now) 
- Changed current and completed clocks to have their own pages to allow for searching to work on both pages. We split it to multiple pages due to less code duplication and easier readability between pages. 

### Issues  

- searching by position doesnt work volunteer list

- when searching on volunteer page, then navigating to a detail page, then pressing the back button, a form resubmission error occurs. this is because the Main search handler doesnt redirect to its get handler

- trying to delete a recurring set with excluded shifts causes a foreign key constraint error (due to a db corruption, was resolved when db was reset)

- datetimepickers need to be set to readonly on schedule

- volunteer active nav links arent highlighting

- volunteer logout can be reversed with back button

- timepicker validation is causing errors on recurringshift modal

### Other 

### Whats up next 

- Smooth over the app to make sure there are no bugs for tomorrow.
- Add readonly to dtp on clockout modal. 
- Add readonly to timepickers everywhere
