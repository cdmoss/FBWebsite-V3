### Progress Log

- Added validation to all time pickers and date time pickers in the application 
- Fixed a lot of js code to allow for more optimized code in use of all tempus dominus time and date pickers. 
- Fixed searching to allow for capital and lower case searching. 
- Fixed searching on timesheets to allow for using both search bars. (Current and completed search bars are working now) 
- Changed current and completed clocks to have their own pages to allow for searching to work on both pages. We split it to multiple pages due to less code duplication and easier readability between pages.
